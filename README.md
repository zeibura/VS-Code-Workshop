# GitHub, VS Code, and Markdown Workshop

The workshop is intended for learning how to work with specific features of the Visual Studio Code IDE, GitHub Desktop, and Markdown. You will learn the following skills:

- Cloning a repository in GitHub Desktop
- Working in a separate branch of the cloned repository
- Using the VS Code editor and source control functionalities
- Editing Markdown files
- Understanding the basics of Markdown format

Before the actual workshop tasks, you will be presented with the introduction to these tools. You will understand why it's more beneficial to use the above-mentioned tools as opposed to only the GitHub website UI. The focus of the workshop is to learn how to benefit from using VS Code in your day-to-day documentation tasks.
